# hkproperty

This is the Harvardx Data Science Capstone project. In this project, we are going to develop a Hong Kong property price prediction model based on various real estate related data in Hong Kong. As required in this data science course, at least 2 prediction models will be built and evaluated. At least one of these models should be developed based on algorithms other than linear or logistics regression.

In this HK property price prediction project, the deliverables include:

The R script which creates and validates the prediction models
The project report which includes the dataset evaluation, model creation procedures, and final result
The Rmd file which includes and generates the R script and project report described in Point 1 and 2
